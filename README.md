# License-Plate-Detection-using-Raspberry-PI4-YOLOV3
Iranian ALPR  task using YOLOV3 (Pytorch)  on Raspberry-Pi 4

## Discription about Project
according to last project in github repo about detecting iranian license-plate detection(LPD) using yolov3 in [Repo](https://github.com/behnoudshafizadeh/iranian-LPR-using-deep-learning-algorithm), we decide to employ that on Raspberri-Pi 4 to illustrate the functionality of LPD on real world. moreover, we provide a structure of deep learning algorithm trained before and tested on different types of License-Plate(LP) in images to investigate the being real-time of our system.

## Requirements
* Raspberri-pi 4B (Hardware)
  * ss
* Raspbian (
